 - multiple eatFruit calls: picking up another call everytime you move past one
 - when transforming stick into wand, pick up another stick
 - Eat Fruit message/action appearing in place of stick/cauldron once gone
    - last message/action it remembers (??)
    == remove event listener
      - calling/stacking functions as i pass them going FORWARD
      / try deleting & rebuilding whole button?

      /refactor class's methods to correct set/get <function>



 - error handling to only get 1 stick, have stick before cauldron message/action
